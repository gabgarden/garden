You went out just to please me
I have to thank you, but baby
You weren't doing nothing but pleasing

So don't waste my time
Don't waste my time on telling lies
Easy to play just roll the dice
Don't waste my time
So don't waste my time

So don't waste my time
You're such a waste of time
So don't waste my time
Don't waste my time
So don't waste my time
So don't waste my time
Don't waste my

I lost you yesterday
It was really heartbreaking
The attitude in my ways
Disgusting you from the beginning

Why did you waste my time?
Why did you waste your time?
Why did you waste our time?
We didn't waste any time
We did not waste any time

So don't waste my time
You are the love of my life
Don't waste my time
You are a waste of time
Don't waste my time
Don't waste my time…
Don't waste my time
Don't waste my

Yesterday was so crowded
But anyway, I felt so alone
I couldn't hear my name even if they shouted
Crowded
Shouted
Alone
I couldn't hear my name even if they shouted`,

It's hard to see that

You don't need to
Stay looking around
For something to hold on
You can just go
And than come back
To see them all

And than i escaped from that shell that sang: comeback to me, baby
And than i ran away from there

Everyday in my house
Getting high
I can't see a thing
Tonight ...

Rolling in the grass
Sailing in the sand again
Rocking everyday
Rocking everynight
With them

And than i realized that i was in the shell again, baby
But now i'm comfortable
Singing
In the sunshine of my life`,

Stand by beside you baby

All that shit you said to me I'll leave behind

Why don't you see?
I moved all the bricks
And every time I look around
I only see my eyes

I'm better free
I think I have to leave
All that shit you said to me I'll leave behind

Look at me
But I don't wanna
You said to me

Anything that's coming out of your mouth

The moss grew over
The ash I see
It burns inside of me
Reminds me of a time I'd rather leave behind

And I don't care
I'm better free
And clean of all that shit
Offer me a bump again and these are your last goodbyes

Look at me
But I don't wanna
You said to me
But I don't wanna hear anything
Anything that's coming out of your mouth

I'm sure
I'm better without you

I'm better without you

I'm better without you
I'm better without you
I'm better off without you

Look at me

Don't wanna be

I was in the car
Waiting for my late driver
I ask him for a cigar
And he only came with a lighter

And then try to stay awake
And keep my good behave

After all, what do I have to prove?
You say I'm wrong, but all mistakes belongs with you
I know you only took the easy way
You lied to me, raped me and now I won't ever hear what you want to say

Didn't know what to say

Good behave, good behave

You can't exist with no lies
